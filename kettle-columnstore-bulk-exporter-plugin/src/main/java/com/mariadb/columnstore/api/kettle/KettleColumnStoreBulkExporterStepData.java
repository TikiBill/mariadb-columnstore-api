/**
 * This class is part of the demo step plug-in implementation.
 * It demonstrates the basics of developing a plug-in step for PDI. 
 * 
 * The demo step adds a new string field to the row stream and sets its
 * value to "Hello World!". The user may select the name of the new field.
 *   
 * This class is the implementation of StepDataInterface.
 *   
 * Implementing classes inherit from BaseStepData, which implements the entire
 * interface completely. 
 * 
 * In addition classes implementing this interface usually keep track of
 * per-thread resources during step execution. Typical examples are:
 * result sets, temporary data, caching indexes, etc.
 *   
 * The implementation for the demo step stores the output row structure in 
 * the data class.
