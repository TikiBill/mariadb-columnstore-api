Usage Introduction
==================

The Java bulk insert API (javamcsapi) is a wrapper around the C++ bulk insert API (mcsapi) generated by SWIG_. As a result Java programmers can utilize the same functions to insert data into ColumnStore tables as C++ developers can do. javamcsapi is available for Java 8 and upwards.
